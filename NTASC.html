									<h2>What is the NTASC about?</h2>
								</header>
								<p>  The North Texas Area Student Conference (NTASC) provides a forum for graduate and undergraduate students 
									in computer-related studies to present their projects, research efforts, or classroom experience to their 
									peers. Conference attendance is for students and faculty. The program includes a keynote address, presentations
									 of papers by students (only), and lunch. NTASC provides a great opportunity for students to view the work of 
									 their peers and to network. Presenters are expected to attend the entire conference. <br><br>
									
									 Registration for the conference is FREE but required. You do not have to present to attend. Door prizes are awarded
									  at the conference lunch! Visit the registration page to register for the conference. The conference is Saturday, 
									  April 17 from 8:30 - 3:30. The deadline for Registration and Abstract submission is Tuesday, March 30th 2020 <br><br>
									
									  Upload Presentation Abstracts or RSVP through the button below. Abstracts are printed in the conference program 
									  (no proceedings are published). </p>

									<h2>Guidelines for Submission of Paper Abstracts</h2>
								</header>
								<p> The abstract is a brief, concise summary of the intent and conclusions of your presentation. Maximum length
									of an abstract is 150 words. Do not include figures, tables or illustrations in the abstract. Please type
									your abstract in Word, single-spaced. Complete spell & grammar check. Use word-count to reduce to 150 words.
									Finally, copy-&-paste the abstract into the indicated box. 
									<br><br>
									<h4>Group Presentations</h4><br>
									DESIGNATE ONE member of the group to submit the abstract. That person will enter the names of ALL the other 
									members of the group in the designated box. ALL other members of the group must register for the conference 
									individually, indicate they are a member of a group presentation, and enter the name of the faculty sponsor 
									and presentation so all names will appear on the program. 
									<h4>Guidelines for Presentations</h4><br>
									Presentations are limited to no more than 15 minutes (plus a 5 minute Q&A). A session moderator introduces 
									each participant. A timekeeper is responsible for ensuring the time schedule is maintained. Student presenters
									 must present at the beginning of the session or they may not be allowed to speak. The program will be 
									 established approximately 10 days prior to the conference and no changes will be made one the program 
									 is complete. Any scheduling requests or requests for special accommodations must be made at least 2 weeks
									  prior to the conference. Presenters should dress professionally. 
									<br><br>
									Each presentation room is equipped with a computer, projector, lectern, and a table. We cannot accommodate 
									personal laptops for the presentations so be prepared to load your materials to the computer in the room. 
									If you have any equipment requests or require accommodations, please contact the conference coordinator at 
									catherine.stringfellow@msutexas.edu at least 2 weeks prior to the conference. 
									<h4>Guidelines for Slides</h4><br>
									Test your presentation slides in a large classroom prior to the day of the conference. The following brief 
									guidelines are highly recommended:
									<ol>
										<li>Light background with dark font (no yellow)</li>
										<li>Simple font (e.g. Arial), font size at least 30 pt.</li>
										<li>Little or no animation</li>
										<li>Images large enough to be seen easily</li>
										<li>Use bullets with short phrases; NO complete sentences</li>
									</ol>
